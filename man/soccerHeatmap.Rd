\title{Draws a heatmap of player position and plots over soccer pitch outlines.}
\usage{
soccerHeatmap(df, bins = 5, lengthPitch = 105, widthPitch = 68,
  yBins = NULL, colLow = "white", colHigh = "red")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe containing x,y-coordinates of player position in columns named \code{'x'} and \code{'y'}.}

\item{bins}{integer, the number of horizontal bins (length-wise) the soccer pitch is to be divided up into. If no value for \code{yBins} is provided, this value will also be used for the number of vertical (width-wise) bins.}

\item{lengthPitch, widthPitch}{numeric, length and width of pitch in metres.}

\item{yBins}{integer, the number of vertical bins (width-wise) the soccer patch is to be divided up into. If \code{NULL}, the same value is used as for \code{bins}.}

\item{colLow, colHigh}{character, colours for the low and high ends of the heatmap gradient.}
}
\value{
a ggplot object of a heatmap on a soccer pitch.
}
\description{
