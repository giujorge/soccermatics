##Pitch dimensions
Many repositories provide relative x,y-coordinates in their positional statistics (e.g. pass location, shot location), using a scale of 0-100 for both length and width. The exact pitch dimensions (i.e. in metres) are therefore needed to determine their true value (e.g. pass length, shot distance).

Pitch dimensions of all Premier League teams as listed on Wikipedia are available in the pitch_dimensions.csv file. For most teams, pitch length and width are given in both metres and yards; where only one unit of measurement has been provided, values in red show their conversion. EPL teams are up-to-date as of the '16/'17 season, but I welcome anyone to expand the list by collecting / scraping Wikipedia for teams from other leagues.

A CSV containing latitude and longitude for 160 European teams is also available [here](http://opisthokonta.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stadiums_20150302.csv) courtesy of opisthokonta.net.
