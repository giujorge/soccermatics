#' @include soccerPitchFG.R
NULL
#' Draws a heatmap of player position frequency in each area of the pitch and adds soccer pitch outlines.
#' 
#' @param df dataframe containing x,y-coordinates of player position in columns named \code{'x'} and \code{'y'}.
#' @param bins integer, the number of horizontal bins (length-wise) the soccer pitch is to be divided up into. If no value for \code{yBins} is provided, this value will also be used for the number of vertical (width-wise) bins.
#' @param yBins integer, the number of vertical bins (width-wise) the soccer patch is to be divided up into. If \code{NULL}, the same value is used as for \code{bins}.
#' @param lengthPitch,widthPitch numeric, length and width of pitch in metres.
#' @param colLow,colHigh character, colours for the low and high ends of the heatmap gradient.
#' @return a ggplot object of a heatmap on a soccer pitch.
#' @details uses \code{ggplot2::geom_bin2d} to map 2D bin counts
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' data(tromso)
#' # draw heatmap of player #9's position
#' soccerHeatmap(subset(tromso, id == 8), bins = 15)
#' }
#' @seealso \code{\link{soccerPitchBG}} for a background soccer pitch for the purpose of drawing position maps, player trajectories, etc..
